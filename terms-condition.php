                            <p>1.<a name="one"></a> Hi, we are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apprangers.net">AppRangers</a> (AppRangers Ltd., RC 1261302) and welcome to AppRangers Major Network, AppRangers’ online sites for digital services. This agreement explains the rules that apply to buying services using the AppRangers Major platform <strong>(‘user terms’)</strong>.</p>
                            
                            <p>2.<a name="two"></a> When we refer to the <strong>‘site’</strong>, we’re talking about the AppRangers platform <a href="http://www.apprangers.net" target="_blank">www.apprangers.net</a>. When we say <strong>‘we’</strong>, <strong>‘us’</strong> or <strong>AppRangers’</strong> it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the site.</p>
                                
                            <p>3.<a name="three"></a> Our user terms apply to any use of the site whether or not you’re a member of the site. The user terms are between you and AppRangers.

                                4. You need to be 16 years or over to browse the AppRangers Major site. We don’t knowingly collect any information from anyone aged 16 and under. If you want to buy services, or use other site features, you need to become a member and be 18 years old or over. Membership is free. We call a member who buys services a <strong>‘buyer’</strong>. When we refer to <strong>‘you’</strong> in these user terms we mean any users of the site (including buyers).
                            </p>
                            <p class="s-no-below">Our <a href="faq.php">FAQ</a> gives more information about AppRangers Major sites and how it works.</p>
                            <h4>Before you buy</h4>
                            <p>
                                5. Buyers are responsible for choosing the right services to meet their needs and making sure that all aspects of the services, including their scope, the number of revisions available and turnaround time meet their needs. Buyers need to  provide to us a full brief for each job. It is the buyer’s responsibility to make sure that the brief is comprehensive and clear.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Agreeing to buy</h4>
                            <p>
                                6. WordPress Major agrees to provide services by entering into a separate agreement directly with the buyer which is called the <strong>'services agreement'</strong>. It is your responsibility to make sure you understand the terms of the services agreement. In these user terms, we use the word <strong>‘job’</strong> to talk about the services that we agrees to provide a buyer under a services agreement.

                            <p>7. The prices advertised on the site for services are set by us. We decide what prices we want to charge. We may change our prices (or change or remove our services) without notice. The price will not change for any job already started.</p>
                            <p>8. All prices are stated and charged in US dollars (USD$). You are responsible for any costs associated with currency conversion or bank charges.</p>
                            <p>9. Buyers pay for services using one of the methods offered on the site (<strong>‘payment method’</strong>). We will give you a job ID and issue a receipt for payment.</p>
                            
                            <p>10. Each of the following things need to happen to ‘close’ the job:</p>
                            <ul class="marker-list">
                                <li>we confirm that the services have been provided and submit content to the buyer for approval;</li>
                                <li>the buyer approves the outcome of the job;</li>
                                <li>we complete the job by providing ‘materials/service’ to the buyer (<strong>‘job completion’</strong>);</li>
                                <li>seven days pass from job completion without a dispute being raised; and</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>11. The prices for services include all indirect taxes (like GST, VAT and sales taxes). We are responsible for providing tax invoices to buyers on request.</p>

                            <p>12.<a name="fourteen"></a> We offer a dispute resolution process for members. This is a benefit of membership. You agree to use the dispute resolution process to resolve any disputes.  You can raise a dispute at any time up to seven days after job completion. We will investigate each dispute, make any decision and take any action to implement our decision (such as making payments or part-payments and releasing content) at our sole discretion.</p>
                            
                            <p>13.<a name="fifteen"></a> Buyers use the seven day period after job completion to make sure that they receive all the final deliverables, that is, all content promised under the services agreement <strong>(‘materials’)</strong>. It is the buyer’s responsibility to make sure that they have received materials before the job is closed as a dispute cannot be raised after that time.</p>
                            
                            <p>14.<a name="sixteen"></a> If a dispute is raised by a buyer at any time before the job is closed, we will try to resolve the dispute. If the buyer is still not satisfied with our dispute resolution process, we will then refund the buyer.</p>
                            
                            <p>15.<a name="seventeen"></a> You can only use the dispute resolution process for services provided and communications made solely via the site or chat channel. A dispute you raise may be ineligible for the dispute resolution process if it involves services provided, or communications made, outside the site or chat channel. If you do not provide us with information or answers to our questions, or otherwise participate properly in the dispute resolution process, we have the right to resolve the dispute in favour of the other member.</p>
                            
                            <p>16.<a name="eighteen"></a> When a dispute is resolved, the repayment will be made via the original payment method.</p>
                            
                            <p>17.<a name="nineteen"></a> You release us from any liability relating to a dispute and the outcome of any dispute resolution process.</p>

Agreeing to use the dispute resolution process does not take away your own rights and you can take your own legal advice at any time.</p>

                            <p>39.<a name="forty-one"></a> Although we can’t force you to accept the decisions we make, and you retain all your legal rights, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel membership of members that do not use this process fairly in our view.</p>

If a buyer issues a charge back through a payment provider, we can’t start the dispute resolution process, or make a payment to the buyer, until that charge back process has been finalized.</p>
