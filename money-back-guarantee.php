                                WordPress Major  uses certum commercial for its SSL certification because they have issued a lot of SSL Certificates for a lot of big brands. Their rigorous authentication practices set the standard for online identity assurance and are audited by independent international auditors since 2002.

                                From time to time a notice may appear on your screen alerting you to the fact that you are moving from a secure server to one which is not secure. Do not be alarmed by this. Only in the secure part will we take personal or card details from you.
