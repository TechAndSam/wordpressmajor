                            <p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>We are the service provider and you are the buyer. We are both members of AppRangers network (the ‘site’) and are bound by the terms of the site user agreement (‘user terms’). We have each agreed to use this services agreement (‘services agreement’) when you buy services using the site. This services agreement is between us.</li>
                                    <li>This services agreement starts when you and us agree on the job. The ‘job’ means the specific services you have requested via the site based on our service description, your brief and any matters we’ve agreed on via the site that clarify and document the scope of services.</li>
                                    <li>This services agreement is a legally binding contract. We are engaged by you as an independent contractor to complete the job.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <hr />
                                <h3>The job</h3>
                                <ol start="4">
                                    <li>You have asked us to complete the job for you. It’s your responsibility to make sure that you pick the right services to meet your needs and that you base your decision on the information published on the site. By making a payment and placing your order with us, you confirm that you understand and are satisfied that all aspects of the job, including its scope, the number of revisions available and the turnaround time, meet your needs.</li>
                                    <li>We promise to each other that we each own, or have the appropriate rights to use, everything that we submit on or via the site to each other. This includes everything that we send to, or make available to, each other including all files, assets, communications and materials (‘content’).</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>Enabling safe transactions – dispute resolution process</h3>
                                <ol start="6">
                                    <li>We agree to use the dispute resolution process to resolve any dispute between us. If a dispute is raised, I understand that I am not owed any payment unless that dispute is resolved in my favour. A dispute raised may be ineligible for the dispute resolution process if it involves services provided, or communications made, outside the site or whatsapp channel. If we have made private arrangements, or have a dispute about services other than the job, we will resolve our dispute between ourselves.</li>
                                    <li>AppRangers holds your payment until each of the following things happen to ‘close’ the job.
                                        <ul class="marker-list">
                                            <li>We confirm that we’ve provided the services and submit content to you for your approval;</li>
                                            <li>you approve the outcome of the job;</li>
                                            <li>We complete the job by providing materials to you (‘job completion’)</li>
                                            <li>seven days pass from job completion without either of us raising a dispute; and</li>
                                            <li>if a dispute has been raised, the dispute resolution process has been finalized.</li>

                                    <li>Either of us can raise a dispute at any time and for up to 7 days after job completion (i.e before the job is closed).</li>

                                    <li>We will provide you with services to complete the job and in return you will pay us the price. We collect payment from you and hold it in a wallet until the job is closed. We will only accept payment made via the site.</li>
                                    <li>You agree to make sure that you have received all materials from us within seven days of job completion. Once the job is closed, AppRangers moves money to her account.</li>
                                    <li>The price for the job includes all indirect taxes (like GST, VAT and sales taxes). We will provide you a tax invoice if you request one. We will each be responsible for bearing all other fees or taxes relevant laws impose on each of us.</li>
                                </ol>

                                    <li>We promise to communicate clearly and promptly with you and to provide the services to complete the job:</li>

                                        <li>in accordance with the brief; and</li>

                                    <li>We promise that we own the content we use to do the job and the materials we deliver to you, or we have all the appropriate rights and licenses to use or provide the content or materials. We promise that you do not have to seek permission from any other person to use any materials we deliver to you and that your use will not infringe the rights of any other person.</li>
                                    <li>Where the materials we deliver to you are our pre-existing materials (such as designs or templates), we give you a worldwide, non-exclusive and perpetual license to use those materials. We will specifically identify any pre-existing materials. This license includes the right to publish, distribute, communicate, broadcast, edit, modify, and create derivative works from those materials.</li>
                                    <li>Where the materials we deliver to you are created by us specifically for the job, we assign all worldwide intellectual property rights (such as copyright) in those materials to you.</li>
                                    <li>If any of the materials we propose to deliver to you are not covered by clauses 14 or 15 (for example they are creative commons, open source or owned by others), we will not deliver such materials unless you have specifically agreed to us including them, and we must also provide you a copy of the relevant use or license terms for those materials.</li>
                                    <li>If the job involves us helping you find additional assets owned by others (e.g. stock photos), you will bear the cost of these additional assets and will license them directly (We will give you instructions on how to do so).</li>
                                    <li>If there is a dispute, charge back or refund process that results in your payment for the job being reversed, you will not have ownership or license rights to the materials we have delivered and you must delete those materials. (In legal speak, in this situation, the license in clause 14 and the assignment in clause 15 is revoked.)</li>
                                    <li>If we assign materials to you and we are in a country which gives us moral rights, we waive our moral rights where permitted by law, or otherwise we consent to the following: We agree that, despite our moral rights, you can store, use, re-use, publish, communicate, edit, alter, adapt, or translate the assigned materials in any medium. We also agree that you do not need to attribute us as the creator of the assigned materials.</li>

                                    <li>Please make sure that you carefully assess whether the job will be suitable for your needs. In some jurisdictions (countries or states) there may be consumer or fair trading law which may give you rights that we cannot exclude, restrict or modify (‘non-excludable law’). We do not exclude or modify any non-excludable law. Except as provided in a non-excludable law, we are bound only by the express promises made in these terms and we are not bound by implied terms.</li>

                                Except as provided in a non-excludable law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages, loss of revenue or loss of profits which result from use of or access to, or an inability to use or access, our services. To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability for breach of any implied warranty or condition that cannot be excluded is limited to either the supply of services again or the payment of the cost of having services supplied again - but only where the services are those supplied by us.
